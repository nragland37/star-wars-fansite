                  Director George Lucas is an American filmmaker and writer. He
                  studied cinematography at the University of Southern
                  California and caught the eye of Francis Ford Coppola, who
                  helped him enter the film business. Lucas is best known for
                  writing and directing Star Wars and creating the Indiana Jones
                  series, as well as founding the Industrial Light & Magic
                  special effects company.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lucas was born George Walton Lucas Jr. on May 14, 1944, in
                  Modesto, California. Lucas's parents sold retail office
                  supplies and owned a walnut ranch in California. His
                  experiences growing up in the sleepy suburb of Modesto and his
                  early passion for cars and motor racing would eventually serve
                  as inspiration for his Oscar-nominated low-budget phenomenon,
                  American Graffiti (1973).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before young Lucas became obsessed with the movie camera, he
                  wanted to be a race car driver, but a near-fatal accident in
                  his souped-up Fiat just days before his high school graduation
                  quickly changed his mind. Instead, he attended community
                  college and developed a passion for cinematography and camera
                  tricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following the advice of a friend, he transferred to the
                  University of Southern California's film school. There, he
                  produced a short futuristic sci-fi film called Electronic
                  Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, and garnered a comfortable spot under
                  the wing of Francis Ford Coppola, who took an active interest
                  in unleashing new filmmaking talent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Coppola convinced Warner Brothers to make a feature-length
                  version of the film, and although a few critics recognized
                  some philosophical depth behind all the technical wizardry,
                  THX 1138 (re-titled) flopped terribly in its 1971 release.

                  Now that Lucas had won back the confidence of his supporters,
                  he set out to make a children's Saturday morning serial that
                  would be part fairy tale, part Flash Gordon and complete
                  fantasy and adventure set in the imaginary frontier of outer
                  space.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project eventually evolved into a full-length feature
                  entitled Star Wars. Released in May 1977, Star Wars blew
                  audiences away with its awe-inspiring special effects,
                  fantastical landscapes, captivating characters (the erroneous
                  pairing of two bumbling droids providing, ironically, the most
                  heart and comic relief) and the familiar resonance of popular
                  myth and fairy tale. Made for $11 million, the film grossed
                  over $513 million worldwide during its original release. Lucas
                  continued the story of the Jedi Knights and the Dark Side in
                  The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Return of the Jedi
                  (1983).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the meantime, he set up a state-of-the-art special effects
                  company, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), as well as a sound
                  studio, Skywalker Sound, and began to execute more and more
                  control over the finished product of his films. He eventually
                  built his own moviemaking "empire" outside of the controlling
                  influence of Hollywood in the hills of Marin Country,
                  California.

                  Finally, technology was catching up with Lucas's creative
                  vision for his famous science-fiction saga. He had seen ILM's
                  capabilities when it was commissioned to bring the dinosaurs
                  of Jurassic Park (1993) to horrifying life. The progressions
                  in technology convinced Lucas that it was time to go back to
                  Star Wars.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lucas embarked on the development of three new prequels —
                  beginning with the menacing Darth Vader as an innocent, gifted
                  young boy. The first in the series, Star Wars: Episode I — The
                  Phantom Menace, was released in the spring of 1999 to high
                  expectations and unprecedented hype and fanfare. The response
                  to the film was mixed. Some critics and Star Wars fans found
                  the characters childish and racially stereotyped. Others
                  complained that the story lacked dramatic depth. No one,
                  however, could argue about the magical quality of Lucas'
                  technologically masterful creations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Defending his latest creation, Lucas argued that The Phantom
                  Menace was a children's movie, as all the Star Wars movies
                  were meant to be before their cult-like magnetism took hold of
                  the American public. However, a behind-the-scenes featurette
                  that accompanied the film's release to DVD in 2001 told a
                  different story, revealing a director who wasn't entirely
                  satisfied with his product. "It's a little disjointed," Lucas
                  says at one point, after watching a rough cut of the film.
                  "It's bold in terms of jerking people around. I may have gone
                  too far in a few places."
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second installment, Episode II—Attack of the Clones,
                  premiered on May 12, 2002, at the Tribeca Film Festival. The
                  third episode, Revenge of the Sith, debuted in May 2005.

                  In addition to being a filmmaker, Lucas has been dedicated to
                  helping improve education through the George Lucas Educational
                  Foundation. Created in the early 1990s, the organization
                  encourages the use of project-based and team-based learning,
                  among other education reforms. The foundation's mission is
                  deeply personal to Lucas, who spent many years as a single
                  father to his adopted daughter Amanda after his divorce from
                  film editor Marcia (Griffin) Lucas in 1983. Following their
                  split, Lucas also adopted two more children, Katie and Jett.

                <p>
                  In January 2013, Lucas announced his engagement to Mellody
                  Hobson, president of Ariel Investments. The couple had been
                  dating for five years prior to their engagement. The
                  69-year-old Lucas and 44-year-old Hobson wed in late June 2013
                  at Skywalker Ranch in Marin County, California. Shortly
                  afterward, they welcomed daughter Everest to the family.
